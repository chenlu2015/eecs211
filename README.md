Distributed Computer System
=======

EECS 211 Project

This project simulates what would be a network system composed of servers, computers and printers that 
connects to a network. Disk drives in computers allow files to be written/removed to memory, 
printers connect to servers to allow printing, and packets are implemented to send information from
computers to servers to printers. 

Although the code is written in C++, methods used are all of the C standard library such as
malloc, free, memcpy, memset, etc. for more efficienct code with less compiler bloat.
